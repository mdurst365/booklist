# About this project

This is a book list created with HTML/ CSS Bootstrap / Vanilla JS. It uses local storage to keep track of a user's favorite books and dynamically display a book list based on the infromation provided by the user. It was created following a tutorial and then I added a bit customized styles and images to improve upon the UI. It was done as a way to continue practicing JS outside of the coding bootcamp.
